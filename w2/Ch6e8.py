#The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides 
# both of them with no remainder.

#One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation 
#that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). 
# As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.

#Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b 
#and returns their greatest common divisor.

#Credit: This exercise is based on an example from Abelson and Sussmanâ€™s Structure 
#and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
