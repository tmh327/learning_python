Alarm clock

1. Current time
2. Alarm time
3. Sound/Vibrate
4. Turn on/off alarm
5. Calculate time until alarm

1. Current time:
    a. Auto
    b. Manual
    c. Get time in conform time unit(*)

2. Alarm time:
    a. Manual input
    b. Translate user input to conform time unit

3. Sound/Vibrate:
    a. API between arduino and sound/vibration device

4. Turn on/off alarm:
    a. API between arduino and user (User Interface) - interupt

5. Calculate time until alarm:
    a. Take user input time - current time
